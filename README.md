2. call /api/Authenticate/login with admin credentials (admin/1234)
3. copy the token
4. in the upper right corner in swagger click "Authorize"
5. Paste in the token and click "Authorize"
6. You can now create a new restaurant which requires that you are authorized and the role "admin"

## Users

| Username | Password | Roles |
|----------|----------|-------|
| admin    | 1234     | admin |
| test     | 1234     | None  |
| test1    | 1234     | None  |
| test2    | 1234     | None  |

## Infrastructure
- API hosted as an Azure App Service (scale-up, scale-out)
- Database hosted as an serverless Azure SQL Database

## Deployment
- Deployment of infrastructure should be done by pipelines to Azure
- Deployment and configuration of code should be done by pipelines to Azure

## What's missing?
- There's no usefull logging to e.g. application insights, file or serilog/elasticsearch.
- Authentication is hardcoded but in the future we could support google authentication, MSAL or Duende Identity Server.
- A UI - either a web app (angular/react) or a mobile app.

## Notes
If you do not provide a location (latitude/longitude) a default loaction in Copenhagen is chosen.

The data seeding adds 13 restaurants in Copenhagen, 1 in HillerÃ¸d and 2 in Billund
